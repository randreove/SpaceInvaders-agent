# SpaceInvaders-agent

In this practical project an agent is created to play the Atari Space Invaders game. For this purpose, a neural network is designed and the DQN algorithm is applied to it with a series of parameters to be configured. Many tests were performed with different architectures and parameters, as well as many training epochs.
